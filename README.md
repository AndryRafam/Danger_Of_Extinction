# Danger_Of_Extinction

This little repository is about building Deep Learning models in order to classify / detect threatned species.
Dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/danger-of-extinction-animal-image-set

### In this project, we are using transfer learning techniques instead of building a model from sracth.

## Result

### VGG16 (Transfer Learning - Fine Tuning)
  - Validation accuracy: 93.43 %
  - Validation loss: 27.63 %

### ResNet50V2 (Transfer Learning - Feature Extraction)
  - Validation accuracy: 91.11 %
  - Validation loss: 27.92 %
